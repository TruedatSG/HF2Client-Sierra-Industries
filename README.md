# HF2Client Sierra Industries

Compiles with VS2010 or newer.

About

Created for Hellfire II originally known as D2Non or D2Unofficial, this is a user mod
for non-commercial use, the Hellfire II logo is also user created by D2Non, now known
as Sierra Industries.

History

This code is based off of the original Project 1.0 hosted at BHFiles.  I found a link to
project back in 2011 on YouTube, I don't recall by which user this was shared but this is
an old Player vs Player mod based off of RedVex modules that were conveniently compiled in
a VS2010 solution titled 'Project' by someone name Boozled and later made well known by
ANDy in 2010-2011 and years beyond that.

This project then branched off into Project Ruby before becoming Project Sapphire.
Project Ruby added some map features (shows notorious monsters), life dots, ui dash,
large experience meter (1/500 ticks compared to 1/120) and gold meter (replaces
the older experience meter).

Premise

The individual modules and design features in Project Sapphire are now made to either be
unlocked by the player via gameplay or can be unlocked by a GM for testing purposes.

Upgrades

Here are a list of upgrades from D2Non (Sierra Industries):

-Kill Counter
-Action Menu
-Player Info
-Side Quests
-Advance Classes
-Key Items (These are mostly made of the modules from Project 1.0, others are visual,
some are collectable)
-Calculus (Design features from ANDy that perform and display simple math)
-Xinput

The code is about 95% complete with some pointers and patches missing, not working, untested.

Todo

More quests and key items,
Fix the patches that aren't working,
Remove unused features (such as the godmode that may never work in 1.13d)

Xinput

It is now possible to play Legacy Diablo II with an Xbox controller, I spent hours testing
and improving the controller layout.  It took about 3 years to accomplish this (testing taking
the majority of time spent working on this plugin).
